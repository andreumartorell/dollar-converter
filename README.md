## Description
This project is based on an exercise in the youtube channel 'Vida MRR - Programacion web' where I create a coin converter from US dollars to Mexican pesos, being able to sum up the expenses and change its currency. This exercise extends the functionality of the exercise being able to see the results in the different currencies. This is an extensive exercise in Typescript as well as JavScript, HTML and CSS.
